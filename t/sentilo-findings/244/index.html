<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>I have been investigating on the Sentilo solutions the last 2 weeks.<br/>
This looks quite promising and applicable to fit in the registry which Amsterdam wants to wants develop.<br/>
After several discussions with the municipality of Barcelona I want to share this general PDF ptresentation with you.<br/>
The system is open, available and seems to provide a good basis.<br/>
We should be able to implement Sentilo with our own programmers quite easy.<br/>
Also the question arise if there is interest to implement such registry tool besides Amsterdam, Gent and Hamburg?<br/>
Can we adopt this as first try out in SCORE?</p>
<p>Maybe we can discuss this next Thursday?<br/>
And decide soon about next practical steps.</p>
<p>Greetings</p>
<p>Hugo<br/>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Aarhus might be interested in this challenge as well, and Michelle and I have already scheduled a meeting on 15.5.2018 to discuss the IoT registry with our bosses, who would be the internal stakeholders for this project if we were to go along. Rasmus from the Danish public digitalisation network OS2 (<a href="https://os2.eu/node/332" rel="nofollow noopener">https://os2.eu/node/332</a>) is also participating in the meeting. Finally, Michelle is part of the EU project “IoT Crawler” (<a href="https://www.wespeakiot.com/iot-crawler-search-engine-for-the-internet-of-things/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.wespeakiot.com/iot-crawler-search-engine-for-the-internet-of-things/</a>) and look for possible overlaps and shared interests between these projects.</p>
<p>We will let you know the outcome of this meeting!</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>
Mikkel</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Today we had an internal meeting with a number of people, chief among them my boss Søren Dall-Hansen (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/s%C3%B8ren-dall-hansen-b223726/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/søren-dall-hansen-b223726/</a>) and Michelle’s boss Bo Fristed (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bofristed/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/bofristed/</a>). There was general agreement that the IoT Registry challenge, with its present scope of looking into the possibilities of Sentilo (<a href="http://www.sentilo.io/wordpress/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.sentilo.io/wordpress/</a>) in a SCORE context, is a very interesting way to go, and Aarhus will therefore take part in this challenge <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/blush.png" title=":blush:"/></p>
<p>In the meeting a number of related projects were identified that Aarhus is also a part of, and that might be of interest to this SCORE challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The EU “IoT Crawler” project (<a href="http://www.iotcrawler.eu/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.iotcrawler.eu/</a>): “IoTCrawler is a search engine for Internet of Things devices, making real-world data accessible and actionable in a secure and privacy-concerned manner. IoTCrawler is a three-year long research project focusing on developing a “Google” for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It aims at a paradigm change on both how IoT application can access IoT resources and on how IoT resources can make themselves discoverable.” Aarhus Kommune (represented by Michelle and others) is part of this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The forthcoming “OS2 IoT” project: OS2, the Danish public digitalization network (<a href="https://os2.eu/node/332" rel="nofollow noopener">https://os2.eu/node/332</a>), is in the process of securing funding for extending The Things Network stack with further LPWAN capabilities, as well as localizing, maintaining and publicizing it among other Danish municipalities and public institutions. Aarhus Kommune is part of this project, and the OS2 secretariat is placed physically in our premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, Aarhus Kommune has its own, wholly owned municipality wide LoRaWAN network for deploying sensors. This means that we eventually will have a real need of a robust IoT registry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Michelle, Ture and I will take part in the upcoming IoT registry challenge telco on the 29th of May.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>
Mikkel</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Perhaps stating the obvious, but OASC brings together interoperability on the level above (or below) specific offerings like Sentilo, in a completely transparent manner, and with many more cities behind, using different approaches, some Sentilo, some other ways.</p>
<p>So at some point, maybe it’s an idea to plan a strategy across the implementation to ensure alignment outside of the vertical/platform?</p>
<p>Said the WP6 lead, again. <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p>I’m in Nice at the TM Forum Digital Transformation event with thousands of providers (and some cities). There is consensus, more or less, on the ambition to align, and score should probably find a way to get this cross-application/-domain perspective on the development path.</p>
<p>I’d be happy to invite a webinar, as you know, on this, very much <em>centered on the practical needs</em>.</p>
<p>And there is the one next week for starters, co-organised by AIOTI and OASC, I’m conversation with W3C and many more:</p>
