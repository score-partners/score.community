<p>Dear partners</p>
<p>Hope all of you are doing well and you had the opportunity to enjoy the summer holiday.</p>
<p>Finally I am able to send out the first attempt of the SCORE business case.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wqkCnZFThrr-FHACkqqe250IXXHhQGX5" rel="nofollow noopener">This link</a> brings you to a folder on the shared drive. Each partner has its own folder containing a link to the actual business case and to an extra document.<br/>
In the extra document you can describe the use case(s) the solution is serving and what (open source) components there are to find in the specific solution.<br/>
It would be great if all partners try to fill in both documents before the upcoming partner meeting.</p>
<p>All your input and feedback can be gathered in your own document (in comments).<br/>
I will collect all of them and then I hope we can discuss your input during the online partner meeting.</p>
<p>It is okay if you try to fill in the template for more than one of your solutions.<br/>
And after a call with Juliette this morning we decided that it is possible that one solution has several business cases.<br/>
For example the QR-toolkit: Bradford and Ghent are both developing a QR-toolkit, with both a different motive, different use cases, different learnings, and so on … So there should be more than one business case of a QR-toolkit.</p>
<p>Please consider how these documents work for you and your colleagues. Here you have several questions to consider while filling in the documents.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the value of the BC and what do you think is missing but could be valuable?</li>
<li>Subjects such as ‘value’ and ‘learning’, what do they mean to you?</li>
<li>If you do not develop or own SCORE solutions yourself, what would you expect from other solutions in these documents?</li>
<li>It would be great if you consider how useful these documents are and for what matters you should or should not use the business case.</li>
<li>What about the data-section than is optional? Is it relevant for everyone or not at all?</li>
<li>The 3th section – quantity, was difficult for me so all feedback or input is very relevant.<br/>
How do you in your city express savings in time or money? And do you consider that on a short term and/or on a long term?</li>
</ul>
<p>This business case should not just be a deliverable to satisfy Interreg, but above all should satisfy all of the partners and everyone interested in our work within SCORE. <img alt=":blush:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/blush.png" title=":blush:"/></p>
<p>I would like to have all of your input one week before the partnermeeting, that should give me enough time to go through all of your feedback and comments.<br/>
So lets set the deadline on Wednesday 16th of September.</p>
<p>Looking forward to see/hear all of you again!<br/>
Thank you all in advance</p>
<p>Kind regards<br/>
Justine</p>
