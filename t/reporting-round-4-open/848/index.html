<p>Dear SCORE partnership,</p>
<p>We still need some more time to formalise the budget change and Interreg also needs time to approve it. To avoid further delays, we have decided together with the JS to launch Report 4 and submit the change request afterwards. Partners are far from overspending so there shouldn’t be any problem. The 4th reporting round has thus been opened on the  <strong>28th of January</strong> .</p>
<p>The 4th report is a full report, meaning  <strong>reporting on Finance is mandatory</strong> . You will have to report on activities carried out and expenses incurred between the 1st of July 2019 to the 31st of December 2019.</p>
<p>***** <strong>Important</strong> : For those partners who did not claim expenses in the 3rd report, the eligibility period for this finance report is the whole 2019! The activity report is still only about the second half of last year. (Stad Gent, City of Bradford, University of Bradford and Digipolis Gent)</p>
<p>We will not reschedule a specific teleconference on reporting, however, if you have any questions on reporting, you can book a call with Mikeldi on the following Meetingbird link:</p>

<p>Please note that to respect Interreg’s schedule, since we are already behind, partners need to give their feedback on the joint report between the 25th of March and the 7th of April, else, it won’t be taken into account. If you have questions or comments about this reporting round, please do not hesitate to contact us anytime.</p>
<p>Godspeed !</p>
