<h1>Webinar series</h1>
<p>Hi community!</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Boris</span> and I would like to propose a series of interview/webinars. We think this will help all of us here build a common understanding of SCORE’s opportunities and hurdles, as well as help disseminate knowledge and kick-start conversations between partners.</p>
<p>These webinars would be open to all partners willing/able to join, but also recorded for the benefit of everyone and turned into blogs for further dissemination. The conversation started during the call could then continue here on the community.</p>
<h2>We are imagining something along the lines of:</h2>
<p><strong>‘Interviews’</strong>: A discussion with invited speakers about key SCORE related subjects. Something along the lines of 5 min intro, 20 min presentation, 5 min question round, 10 min responses, 20 min open floor (60 min total).</p>
<p><strong>‘Panel discussions’</strong>: In which we invite 3 speakers from other similar initiatives to share their experiences. Something along the lines of 5 min intro, 8 min each speaker, 10 min discussion between panel, round of questions, 10 min answers, round of questions, 10 min answers, open discussion (90 min total)</p>
<p><strong>Structure</strong>: We could have one every 2 weeks starting mid June (but not in August) Friday morning at 11. Both could be hosted/moderated by me &amp; directly linked to activities the partners are doing.</p>
<h2>Our initial ideas include:</h2>
<h3>Interviews</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="mention">@Boris</span> - What is open source software?</li>
<li>
<span class="mention">@brynskov</span> - How can and why should cities collaborate when investing in technology?</li>
<li>
<span class="mention">@brynskov</span> - What are minimum interoperability mechanisms, how can you get involved in Synchronicity and how can you take up the OASC recommended interoperability specifications?</li>
<li>
<span class="mention">@Boris</span> - What existing open source projects in cities can we learn from?</li>
<li>
<span class="mention">@c.mullie</span> - How can we include open source in our procurements when working service providers?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<h2>Panel Discussion</h2>
<ul>
<li>Berent (City of Amsterdam), Bart (City of Gent), Bo (OS2 Foundation) - Round table discussion on the value of open source for cities</li>
<li>
<span class="mention">@brynskov</span> + 2 invitations (?) - What have we learnt from Synchronicity in organising long term collaboration between cities?</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<h2>What we want to hear from you</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you think this is a good idea?</li>
<li>What other topics would you like to learn about &amp; who else could we speak to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Boris and I thought perhaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>domain specific (water/traffic) open source projects,</li>
<li>how to hire and manage freelance developers,</li>
<li>how to make the business case for open source (to your management),</li>
<li>how to design ‘replicable by default’,</li>
<li>guidelines to evaluate the ‘openness’ of a solution (data, code) and how it fits in to your administration (integrating w/ past, current &amp; future systems)</li>
</ul>

<p>Is your audience mainly internal or external?<br/>
Had really good results with (the proprietary) <a href="http://Zoom.us">Zoom.us</a>.</p>
<p>Very stable connections, decent bitrate. Hosted a webinar in 2016 with the Council of the European Union for the Diplohack hackathon series with me as director in Ghent, speakers in Brussels, Luxemburg and Strassbourg. Worked like a charm, no fallout, everything transitioned smoothly. Audio worked 100% of the time, directors could mute speakers, determine which camera was on screen and manage the written questions.<br/>
AFAIK a lot of the open source alternatives are conference meeting tools, hardly any webinar tool (like Jitsi for example).</p>

<p>Would love to be in the open source panel thingy. For open data, the city of more knowledgable on that, or at least it is their core task description <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:"/> not mine.

<p>Sure, we could swap you around with Bart?</p>
<p>A session on transnational agile development sounds good</p>
<p>My idea re audience was: perhaps start with the core questions we are trying to answer for SCORE, with SCORE partners + colleagues participating, but keeping the conversation generic enough that it also becomes a resource for other interested parties.</p>
