<p>Hi Boris,</p>
<p>I think there are similarities, but Stay Put solutions are meant to be quite simple, as (I believe) opposed to GeoNetBake solutions which are quite sophisticated, if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>Basically, we just retrofit an off-the-shelf sensor to a piece of equipment, connect it up to a standard, off-the-shelf platform, show stuff on a map, and create some alerts for people who need them. For the time being, this is for (somewhat) rapid prototyping and smaller projects. If the projects grow, we might reevaluate what to do with them.</p>
<p>What we hope to do re SCORE is to share and specify what we do, with what equipment, and how we do it, sharing descriptions, flow, code snippets and does-and-dont’s, so other cities can use this for simple, fast IoT  prototyping.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>
Mikkel</p>

<p>Hi Boris, hi Mikkel,</p>
<p>I see some similarities in the Monitoring of the sensors. That is also what we want to do with GeoNetBake in SCORE. To monitor the positions of the beacons.</p>
<p>And in the Monitoring the simplicity of the data shouldn’t make a big difference. Maybe we can have a Chat on that tomorrow in the working tables.</p>

<p><strong>Working table 1 notes: "Simple State"</strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are these solutions intended for prototyping or for production/upscaling?</strong></p>
<p>Both. The flexibility of the concept and platforms should allow both for rapid prototyping of few devices for a use case and for scaling to larger “production like” platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the concept of “archetypes”?</strong></p>
<p>It’s the idea of creating a set of simple, generic IoT-based solutions that can be used in a multitude of use cases. Everything surrounding the sensor itself (testing, assuring good quality, checking battery life</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can these solutions be specific instead of generic?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the third case we’re looking at (not in scope for SCORE) is very specific to the context/domain. The platform/infrastructure being used should be able to</p>
<p><strong>Q: What LPWAN is used for these IoT solutions?</strong></p>
<p>LoRaWAN for now but should be decided on a case-by-case based on what transmission technology would work best for the best case</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is the LPWAN running in private or shared mode?</strong></p>
<p>Started out as shared/roaming but might need to move to private because of legal issues</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is the LPWAN built on own assets/buildings and on own backhaul infrastructure?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, on city-owned libraries/schools and on municipal fiber</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can the strategy be shared?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s not in any way done yet but can be shared (also for input) along the way. More relevant maybe - also our proces/learnings along the way that lead to the strategy can be shared</p>
<p><strong>Q: can you elaborate more on your use cases and business value so far or can you share info on that</strong></p>
<p>Business value for electrical cabinets could be the ability to monitor the temperature, to avoid equipment damage and fires, and monitor humidity, to get early warning of leakage or flooding. For road temperatures (specifically bike lanes), business value could be timely data on need for gritting or snow removal during winter, to keep bike lanes open so hopefully fewer citizens will resort to commuting by car. For room temperature, we think of a specific instance of some elderly people becoming agitated if the room they are in is too hot, so measuring temperature will enable staff to move them to a cooler room if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Don’t these requirements for the archetypes differ between contexts?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and maybe one archetype actually consist of several “pre-approved” options that allows for different sizes, mounting options etc.</p>
<p>And the strategy part hovering “above” these archetypes define in a standardised way how to “put new solutions on the shelf” and the process for “putting archetypes into use”, e.g. how to best mount a device, placement considerations for this or that specific archetype sensor etc</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can we make the solution(s) more shareable and applicable in other business areas?</strong></p>
<p>Create five practical toolkits that help people set up simple versions of what they want to obtain in the long time.</p>
<p><strong>What are some additional use cases/archetypes you come to think of?</strong></p>
<p>Yunus: Movement sensor in homes (elderly), living room + bedroom. Based on specific needs from “Adults and Elderly” department. Sigfox worked perfectly fine indoor</p>
<p>Tim: Sheep that come into the city and eat grass (instead of mowing)</p>
<p><strong>Most important requirements for sensors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you use stable suppliers that are well-known and can deliver/replace if issues.</p>
<p>Make sure battery life is good and the robustness of the solution and visually discrete in the urban space</p>
<p>Privacy and perceived risk of the “thing” in the street</p>
<p>Awareness of biases in documentation</p>
<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong></p>
<p>What are your ideas for other use cases in the Simple State project</p>
<ul>
<li>Homes - Movement: Living room and bedroom. Bradford measures in 10 homes, 2 SigFox sensors each. Good indoor coverage. Possible to measure activity, also possibly if person gets up too many times per night, might have a urinary infection?</li>
<li>Homes - Temperature: Is the house too cold during winter? Possible to do intervention from Adult Services staff</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the most important requirements for sensors?</p>
<ul>
<li>Good suppllier</li>
<li>Long battery life</li>
<li>What level of data can be sent</li>
<li>Robustness (sensor, casing)</li>
<li>Discreet (avoid tampering and vandalism)</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Awareness of biases in documentation (AI, algorithms)</li>
<li>Transparency</li>

<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Q: Lifesaver: how many sends a week/a day. Does it ping more when it is not at its normal location?</strong></p>
<p>Normally sleeps, accelerometer wakes it up and starts sending GPS coordinates when the life saver is moved.</p>
<p><strong>Any ideas for other use cases?</strong></p>
<p>Vinny: Defibrilators</p>
<p>Adrian: Its not necessarily about staying put but in the UK individuals will use the electricity intended for the street light for their own use e.g. steal the electricity. So if you are adding some sensor technology it could be worth some form of monitoring of the power usage?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Syd</span>, Yes flap valves would be useful, however many are owned by Scottish Water a separate authority. I would need to think a bit further to find other possibilities.</p>
<p>Kim Lantto: Our air quality project sensors are not that robust but easy to build: <a href="https://luftdata.se/bygg/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://luftdata.se/bygg/</a></p>
<p><strong>Q: So I understood that you use an open source management system for the monitoring of the sensors, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, but currently no. We currently use the commercial version of ThingsBoard but want to go (and extend) the OS/community version.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you monitor data, do you have any automatic event detection (event = it has been moved)?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, event monitoring will be part of the solution</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is total cost of setup of new idea a barrier. For eg. equipping one single tree for a test period vs. equipping all risk trees at once to have a lower “per tree” price.</strong></p>
<p>Aim is to lower the price by making the solutions generic, easier/cheaper to buy and implement in bulk and the platform shared across all different use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Q: A related question about this: Here we have had this conversation about whether the city department or ‘we, the tech builders &amp; bringers’ are the ‘product owner’ of what is built. How do you look at the product owner role in Aarhus?</strong></p>
<p>On-going discussion. Shifts over time - we push ideas, prototypes etc. until the business is mature enough or ready to pull these and additional solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So who provides ongoing support? Developer or owner?</strong></p>
<p>Depends on the setup (commercial vendor offering support, internal super users etc.)</p>
<p>Dhaval: Apache Flink offers a Complete Event Processing framework - and we have some experience of dealing with it. If you can share data, we can definately look into it (I have a PhD student)</p>
<p>Tim (re: business cases/value)</p>
<p>Thanks, should you document these business value extrapolations from the prototype. Please do share with Justine for SCORE business case template.</p>
<p><strong>Most important requirements for sensors, visualisation and alarms</strong></p>
<p>Long battery life</p>
<p>Should blend in with environment</p>
<p>Reliability, low maintenance</p>
<p>Data accuracy</p>
<p>Robustness</p>
<p>Share experience from implementing devices</p>
<p>Easy to install, idiot proof as operatives might not have technical skills</p>
<p>Battery replacement or charging requirements</p>
<p>Reduce false alarms</p>
<p>Geofencing</p>
<p>Battery levels and also devices not sending data, but also alerts around LoRaWAN gateways being down</p>
<p>Resilience on your gateways, networks etc.</p>
<p>Also need to consider test and production gateways</p>
<p><strong>Most important requirements in general</strong></p>
<p>A business case</p>
<p>Maintenance</p>
<p>Separate get it up and running (which not everyone is interested in), and keep it running</p>
<p>Manage expectation of stakeholders vs reality</p>
<p>Transparency to achieve acceptance by the public</p>
<p>Trust in the longevity - the solutions, platforms etc. will live on</p>
<p><strong>Other ideas for archetypes?</strong></p>
<p>Kits especially opening up certain local possibilities for citizens. The city provide the hardware and allow citizens to create measurements.</p>
<p><a class="onebox" href="https://loviot.se/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://loviot.se/</a></p>
<p>Humidity in flower beds</p>
<p>As a city you also face certain challenges regarding security of certain events, like G20 where you need to close certain infrastructures like shafts, using sensors would be way cheaper then for example closing them using manual labor</p>
<p>monitoring dangerous structures/subsidence</p>
