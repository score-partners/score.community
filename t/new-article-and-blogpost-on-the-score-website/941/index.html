<p>Hey <span class="mention">@everyone</span>,</p>
<p>I would like to share two new news items with you that we have just published on the SCORE website.</p>
<p>The first one is a short summary of the Partner Meeting in April. Thank you <span class="mention">@Kalle</span> for writing it and to everyone who contributed with thoughts and quotes.</p>
<p>You can find the article here: <a href="https://northsearegion.eu/score/news/digital-partner-meeting/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://northsearegion.eu/score/news/digital-partner-meeting/</a></p>
<p>The other one is a blogpost on air quality monitoring by <span class="mention">@sydsimpson</span> . Thank you for writing and sharing it! We hope this will serve as inspiration for everyone to write similar pieces that could potentially lead to a blog series.</p>
