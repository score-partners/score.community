<p>Hi everyone, just to let you know that I will be moving to a new role within Aberdeen City Council (ACC) on the 30th of November. This means that Agata Kowal, External Funding Officer will take over as the ACC financial officer for the SCORE project.</p>
<p>It was good to meet some of you in person last year at the partner meeting in Bergen. I am glad we have still had SCORE virtual meetings and were able to keep in touch.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best for the SCORE project,</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tanita</p>
