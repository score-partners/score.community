<p>We have created two forms - one for <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAV9furHGB2S2Gl2k9qSPTxuhpgcxuFsis3mBZejLHgrsl9A/viewform" rel="nofollow noopener">data inventory</a> and another for <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScfihNudlGMusSXtXHI6WpzYctdVCRZf4SDhGmYb4y8bzx3jA/viewform" rel="nofollow noopener">infrastructure/architecture inventory</a> and trialled them with two partners.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback from the trial, new versions were created. These forms are now shared with all the partners through their individual working groups. Partners are requested to provide input and we are happy to work with everyone to ensure that the data collection exercise is worthwhile for everyone.</p>
<p>Once we have collected data, we will share it with everyone, including the insights and some analysis that we hope will be useful for the solutions development.</p>
<p>Many Thanks<br/>
