<p>In Ghent over the last years several of our developers &amp; teams have built up quite some experience towards a quick method to produce a generic project website.</p>
<p>‘Project’ being a (local/regional/EU) partnership or even a single activity (eg. conference, hackaton, …) which basically wants to present itself to the outside world in a straightforward, hassle free fashion. See this as the typical one-page presentation website we repeatedly need. This would include a lof of default (reusable!) building blocks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>project hero block</li>
<li>description of project</li>
<li>project partner logos and descriptions</li>
<li>project methodology (icons etc)</li>
<li>project sponsors</li>
<li>project call to action</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>An idea/ambition that grew here over the last months is to make this a semi-standard approach for (smart) cities, as an open package in SCORE.</p>
<p>The approach itself is CMS-less &amp; static, but through using open source libraries, frameworks, themes and Github its setup process would become potentially the modular, replicable and customizable process we need. A quick win for each partner (+ beyond SCORE) if you ask us.</p>
<p>What we are proposing is to extract the experiences and current practices gathered from producing a couple of such websites, and build &amp; document a central approach.</p>
<p>Possible frameworks to start from:<br/>
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a><br/>
<a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">Vuepress</a><br/>
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a><br/>
and <a href="https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators">many more</a></p>
<p>We believe it would produce a good SCORE code deliverable, and would benefit all partners both in the short term (eg. co-develop it for a SCORE related activity in your city, a workshop etc.) as on the long run (to have it in your toolbelt as a city, reusable for you to present your city’s projects and activities). We think it’s especially useful for project that you do with partners, where a city website is less suited for the purpose of presenting the overall project perspective.</p>
<p>We are wondering if other cities would be interested to co-develop if we take the lead on this. (Or even partners that would like to take the lead themselves.)</p>
<p>Please indicate your reaction on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XKKDu_qvJzp0v1iInYSlI2dP5j8BcjKa2zjKvmlyvu4/edit">proposal overview google sheet</a>! before 10th of April 2019 (also if it’s a no for you)</p>

<p>At the City of Amsterdam we’ve created a Jekyll Theme that can be used for various things and sites that are quickly set up. I’ve liked this set up and there is some use.</p>
