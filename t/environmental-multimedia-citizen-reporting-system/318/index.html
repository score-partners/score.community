<p>From my last call with <span class="mention">@srudinac</span> &amp; <span class="mention">@m.worring</span> from Data Science at University of Amsterdam I learnt they are working together with the City of Amsterdam on a multimedia citizen reporting system (so you can take a picture of trash/etc… ), mainly focused on liveable environment.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@pjppauwels</span> I know you/Gent is keen to explore some environmental challenges, and if I am not mistaken <span class="mention">@HansF</span> mentioned something about a citizen reporting system</p>
<p>Just wanted to park here so we can potentially pick this up later</p>

<p>Yes! Always open for 311 projects (<a href="http://www.open311.org/">http://www.open311.org/</a>).</p>
<p>We have a first implementation with the City of Ghent together with IVAGO (the commercialised trash service) called the Notification app for Ghent.</p>
<p>Android: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gent.stad.meldingsapp.cordova&amp;hl=nl">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gent.stad.meldingsapp.cordova&amp;hl=nl</a><br/>

<p>It is in fact Open 311 based, so in the long run, we could add more city issues apart from illegal dumping of trash, like Fix my street / Pothole notifier / broken streetlights / … you name it.</p>
<p>Just watch out that implementing an Open 311 specification is not just a technical challenge, but also a political / administration challenge. You need political approval to have an open channel like this and thus budget to implement such a notification service + your administration needs to be prepared (If IVAGO wasn’t getting enough notifications via telephone because of the barrier of having to look for the number and call it, they do now have a lot of feedback via the app, so they need to make sure they have the people and time to respond to the calls).</p>

<p><em>(from an e-mail conversation but pasting my reply here)</em></p>
<p>As I mentioned in the WPL call this morning, the “Open311” group in SCORE is indeed growing to become a very promising one. I see a remarkable lot of intended commitments from cities (5 codevelopers!). In other words, let’s consider this potentially a highly enthousiastic and relevant SCORE working group.</p>
<p>A lot of green coloured boxes however also brings a rich diversity together:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of existing solutions (an impressive collection if you watch all the partners contributions, but in general most of them – including the Ghent app – are not very mature in terms of open source or open data --&gt; an opportunity to becoming more open and ‘mature’ as result of the SCORE collaboration?)</li>
<li>Diversity in terms of which city service domains to apply “citizen reporting” to</li>
<li>Diversity even from the related challenge working groups perspective (the idea to activate citizens ‘as a Sensor’, the idea of capturing and facilitate more citizen signals, to give citizens insights into the administration and processes behind the scenes (what happens with my report after submitting?), etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the question is: how do we turn our intentions, expectations, potential into the actual development of something that makes sense (= that all partners see as worth putting our efforts in). From Ghent side we are still in the process of collecting more detailed information (our reporting system’s roadmap, components, backend etc). I will be able to be more concrete after my next meeting with business analysts of our current reporting system, on 26 February. Until then I can’t provide additional information except what is shared by Pieter-Jan <a href="https://score.community/t/environmental-multimedia-citizen-reporting-system/318/2">here</a>. An interesting link while defining what has already been built is also <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/Software/" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a> collecting all known Open311 issue reporting implementations.</p>
<p>We have some aligning to do and have to agree on a work plan. I think this could become a SCORE achievement and especially it potentially plays an important role for you Eva in the Living Labs work package (involvement of a lot of partners + a large civic component).</p>

Air quality is a very topical issue in Bradford as the City has been told by Government to develop and implement an air quality management plan.<br/>
In addition developing a strategy to reduce emissions, I am also aware of the need to raise awareness and understanding amongst the city residents. I have been in discussion with <a href="http://www.wellnorth.co.uk/pathfinders/well-bradford/welcome-to-well-bradford" rel="nofollow noopener">‘Well Bradford’</a> a local healthcare initiative about the possibility of providing  a citizens as sensors type service to 2 or 3 schools to demonstrate the variation in pollution between busy road junctions, the school grounds and a local ‘green space’ . The timescale to deliver this is very short however and so in this case is unlikely to happen.<br/>
There may well be further opportunities in the future however and we have submitted a challenge proposal in the recent round for each partner to supply 15 new challenges.</p>

<p>My answer was:</p>
<p>Extending our current reporting app/reporting dataflows (limited to litter on the streets) somehow to the broader ‘signalen’ / picking up more signals in the broader sense, is something that Ghent probably could set up as solution development in SCORE. I’m exploring the possibilities.</p>

<p>At the partner meeting in Aarhus, we (Ghent, Amsterdam, Amsterdam Data Science, Bradford University, Gothenburg) gathered in a working group to discuss ‘Open311’ and ‘Environmental multimedia citizen reporting system’.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amsterdam is handling around 300.000 reports by citizens a year (a range of possible topics, and through a range of channels) and - in close cooperation with Amsterdam Data Science - actively explores the benefits of machine learning (both text based classification and submitted image recognition), mainly to assist the operators that relay, follow up and communicate on such reports. Feedback is provided to the reporting citizen within 3 days. Smart priority/urgency tagging and rules help to manage the stream of incoming reports and complaints in the promised timeframe.</li>
<li>Ghent has a reporting app for street litter operational, Open311 based, allowing citizens to submit pictures, exact location, define categories of litter (to properly link reports to the responsible city service). Thanks to technical workflows, reports are mapped, integrated  and attached to traditional CRM systems, mainly the one of the trash company, efforts were put in smooth “case management”.</li>
<li>Gothenburg also offers a citizen reporting system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decisions</strong></p>
<p>We did not come to one particular system to build, therefore we decided to fall back to:<br/>
a) continue inspiring each other with developments in our cities and relevant insights, and<br/>
b) formalize the ideation that we started (as a SCORE collaboration the citizen reporting topic remains promising and we hope to reveal the common ground)</p>
<p>We will continue this discussion in the ‘Environment’ challenge working group, based on how the ‘Water’ group progresses, a challenge working group might enable us to continue exploring possibilities more formally and methodically. We hope that the process of facilitating, common solution ideas, validation, prototyping, A/B tests etc. will help us come up with an actual common solution plan driven by multiple SCORE co-developing partners.  We count on the D3.1 guidelines to guide our enthousiasm into a tangible and mutual beneficial new product, initiative or proof of concept <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/wink.png" title=":wink:"/></p>
<p><strong>Other notes</strong></p>
<p>As thematic scope we seem to agree on garbage reports and the many ‘shades of grey’ within ‘Trash’ as a reporting cluster. But other citizen report topics (abandonded bikes for instance) were not excluded at this point.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amsterdam Data Science is interested in collecting specific image datasets to improve accuracy of visual classification models.</li>
<li>Both communication (answering, at least giving information on which service the report was relayed to, giving information if it takes some time to process, etc.) and action (what is done about the report visually on the reported location, eg. removing the object that was reported in public domain) are to be considered in a succesful case management workflow.</li>
<li>As is the case in many technologic applications, for language processing based machine learning, languages and even local nuances in wordings typically used by citizens form a barrier to replicate the reached accuracy of classification models</li>
</ul>
<p>To be continued.</p>
