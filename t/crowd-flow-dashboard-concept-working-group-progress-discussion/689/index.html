<p>Hi <span class="mention">@h.niesing</span> <span class="mention">@Jaccobrouwer</span> <span class="mention">@Amsterdatamas</span></p>
<p>Ghent is interested in replicating/co-developing the ‘Drukteradar’ project. We’d like to find out first what is feasible in SCORE. Particularly we’re interested in the perspective of crowdedness in the sense of ‘Impact of (large) events on mobility’. We see this possibly evolve from a standalone application for the mobility department, then to a wider group of other city stakeholders related to large events, then to reach further into citizen communication uses, crowdedness metrics as open data, etc.</p>
<p>Using open data, API’s, widgets etc. as interfaces, a collaboration might be set up with <a href="https://score.community/t/communicating-the-impact-of-events-on-mobility-traffic/117/24">TMaaS project</a> and the traffic management systems (dashboards, trigger events, data flows, communication flows etc.) they are building. (Might, as in if agreement reached with TMaaS consortium and ofcourse on the condition that it complements what they build rather than overlapping with them)</p>
<p>With this post I am creating a proper thread for this as a new proposed solution based working group.</p>
<p>Most relevant Drukteradar information on community is <a href="https://score.community/t/drukteradar/463">here</a> and <a href="https://score.community/t/communicating-the-impact-of-events-on-mobility-traffic/117/9">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you and looking forward.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@timvanachte</span></p>
<p>I am working at the drukteradar project in Amsterdam. And was just recently introduced to SCORE. Great platform and great initiative to explore opportunities to co-develop! I think it could be very useful! And you are ofcourse welcome to check (and replicate) our progress on github, but I believe atm it is limited on the topic of (large) events.</p>
<p>The impact of (large) events on mobility is indeed a very interesting usecase! We are in the process of exploring the use cases, getting the right data and getting the right group of city stakeholders together - also outside of the mobility department.</p>
<p>There indeed seems to be a much wider demand for the info. For example for permits (event, construction etc.). Or for estimating impact of events on the neighborhood (waste collection, enforcement, event policy, pedestrian policy, bike (storage) policy, car parking policy etc.). As you mention, there are also possible communication uses (to residents, visitors and ‘travel info providers’ etc.) and to establish metrics.</p>
<p>We are curious about the cases you are coming across and the application for the mobility department you are mentioning <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:"/>. And its very interesting to explore possibilities to co-develop!</p>

<p>Hi Pepijn,</p>
<p>I’m Tim’s automated out-of-office message. This week he is somewhere warm where mobility issues are the least of his issues and he’ll be back next monday. Is <a href="https://github.com/Amsterdam/city-dynamics/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Amsterdam/city-dynamics/</a> the right GitHub link? If yes, we will definitely look into it. I think <span class="mention">@Jefwillems</span> and <span class="mention">@HansF</span> might be interested in the setup of the project. On the usecases side and link with our mobility department <span class="mention">@PhilippeDB</span> is the best contact within this community. Anyway they’re free to already start the conversation online, but maybe it’s a good idea to setup an online call somewhere next week to see what’s what?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>That is the right link for the github. I will double check if its up to date and let you guys know!</p>
<p>I think an online call is a good idea! Unfortunately next week I will be working limited hours. But we could do a call feb the 12th at 14.00hrs? Then I can also invite Tom Knijff our product owner. Would that work for you?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ll be on vacation next week when you plan to organise the call. Since Gothenburg wants to know more about Drukteradar to be able to decide whether to follow this initiative or not, I wonder if there is any documentation in English that we can take part of?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@Pepijnhofstede</span></p>
<p>Each working group in SCORE is making the intended collaborations more concrete by filling out a template (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZbVTjweKbNiaf7U-2AIcwHqQBhGEFNe3dChFqH-YbF8/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">this doc</a>, to be more specific). For Drukteradar we agreed to have our next conf call beginning of March, such a template is valuable in preparing this next call (and defining the roles of organisations, teams and people we involve).</p>
<p>Have you already considered whether you would like to go for leading role in this SCORE working group (that is, coordinating the follower and replicator cities) or you’re more comfortable in just providing input to us, letting us take the lead in actually co-ordinating the transnational collaboration.</p>
<p>I presume this is also something you should discuss with <span class="mention">@h.niesing</span>. Amsterdam is leading the SCORE solution development work package and Hugo is main contact for this leading role.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hugo/Pepijn/Tom, did you come to a conclusion in terms of whether Drukteradar team is interested in also taking the lead in this SCORE solution working group, or do you think Amsterdam would prefer this working group lead role to be taken by the main replicator of Drukteradar, Ghent?</p>
<p>I think this decision is the most important first big step, after which we can continue our work on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZbVTjweKbNiaf7U-2AIcwHqQBhGEFNe3dChFqH-YbF8/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">fact sheet</a>.</p>
