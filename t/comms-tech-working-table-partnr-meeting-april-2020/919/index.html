<p><strong>In attendance:</strong><br/>
Aarhus University, Ghent, Foundation for Public Code, Johanneberg Science Park, Amsterdam, Aberdeen, Bradford</p>
<p>The WT started out with a round of introductions around the table before Aarhus University briefly took stock of communication activities.</p>
<p>There was an introduction to the new people on the comms team, Kata (who was on holiday, borontekata@cc.au.dk) and Kalle (kallekusk@cc.au.dk) who will be replacing Janne and Benoît who no longer work for Aarhus University. An encouragement to all partners to keep the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JWZMgya5SOgBobM87112T0mkoSIGc4k5L6ut-pwxWFw/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">comms contacts document</a> updated.<br/>
The SCORE project and multiple partners attended the Connected Smart Cities And Communities Conference in Brussels in January. The mentioning of this point sparked discussion of the potential of no physical events within the next year where partners agreed that while the barrier to attend will be lower, the landscape will be more competitive than before (Thanks <span class="mention">@timvanachte</span>  for noting that down!).<br/>
Since the last meeting the SynchroniCity project has finalized which has resulted in <a href="https://synchronicity-iot.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SynchroniCity-guidebook.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">the guidebook</a> which has also been part of the <a href="https://northsearegion.eu/score/news/a-universal-guide-to-make-your-city-fit-for-the-digital-transformation/" rel="nofollow noopener">SCORE communications.</a><br/>
<strong>Discussion:</strong><br/>
Based on this document there was a discussion on communicating solutions touching on the points below.</p>
<ul>
<li>There should a focus on ensuring that SCORE aligns with other initiatives such as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/join-boost-sustain-european-way-digital-transformation-cities-and-communities" rel="nofollow noopener">Join, Boost, Sustain Declaration</a>, the OASC MIMs (<a href="https://oascities.org" rel="nofollow noopener">OASCities.org</a> / <a href="https://oascities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/OASC-MIMs.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">MIMs</a>) and other key initiatives.</li>
<li>Solutions are there, but often lack a SCORE angle</li>
<li>Looking at components rather than solutions could be a potential approach</li>
<li>Solutions with versatility – presenting solutions with a focus on how different cities were able to reuse components and build the services they need</li>
<li>Dealings with this issue ties very closely with all the other work packages</li>
<li>Discussing technology readiness level as part of the communications<br/>
<strong>Looking ahead:</strong><br/>
The discussion on communicating solutions and the partners will be continued on the monthly comms meetings (next one is in May)<br/>
Aarhus University will propose a way to communicate the insights from the interviews regarding partner visions</li>
</ul>
