<p>This deliverable relates to the internal communication between developers and city personnel on solutions to support knowledge transfer and update solutions.</p>
<p>During our work package lead planning meeting we decided it would be useful to design a monitoring framework to follow all SCORE projects status/maturity so that partners report uniformly and there is a collective streamlined oversight which is also open to externals.</p>
<p>It could include:<br/>
o        Overview of challenge teams and main contacts (technical + domain level)<br/>
o        Place where things can be published and viewed including the status of the development, code, how to get involved, etc</p>
<p>Each city should also have one lead contact point who has oversight of all solutions their organisation is involved in.</p>
<p>The question is here: what should this ‘portal’ look like? Could score.community be the right place to do this?</p>
