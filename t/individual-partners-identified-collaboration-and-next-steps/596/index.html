<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Ideas &amp; possible collaborations identified by Gothenburg during the speed-dating session can be found below:</p>
<p><strong>Trafiken.nu</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Interest was expressed by Amsterdam, Bergen, Hamburg &amp; Aarhus.
<ul>
<li>It seems that Amsterdam might be interested mostly in Trafiken.nu. We are ready to support Amsterdam when they are ready to dig deeper into Trafiken.nu. Book a meeting soon ?</li>
<li>Bergen’s interest was based on a need to find faster ways for fire trucks. This may be supported with a route planner that takes into account the current traffic conditions/actual travel times. That is outside the scope for Trafiken.nu (at least at the moment).</li>
<li>Hamburg provides an open data platform but does not develop apps. "The market" is supposed to develop apps based on the open data.</li>
<li>Aarhus stated earlier that other mobility services are in focus right now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Digital services for bicyclists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kim and Malin investigated what digital services there are related to cyclists in other cities, and pitched their very new ideas on how to enhance <strong>Gothenburg’s existing app Cykelstaden (Biketown)</strong> . There are no other services available in the other cities right now with the content we are planning. At the moment there is no material or roadmap available from Gothenburg city to be shared. If updates available, they will be shared in 2019.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first step is to make a roadmap and establish it internally at the Urban Transport Administation in Gothenburg. Right now, the resources needed in this work are busy in other high-priority activities, so the roadmap is probably ready in the beginning of 2019. Then it can be presented on the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gent &amp; Hamburg initiatives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Malin is interested to know more about Gent initiatives <strong><a href="http://TMaaS.eu" rel="nofollow noopener">TMaaS.eu</a></strong> and <strong>MoniTHOR</strong> . These where not addressed during the meeting in Gent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interest in initiatives within mobility services from Hamburg.<br/>
A meeting will be scheduled for mid-December.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other initiatives that might be interesting for Gothenburg</strong></p>

<a href="https://score.community/t/new-ideas-from-the-analysis-gent-digipolis-made/188">Smart Gritting/Salting </a>by Bradford &amp; Aarhus</li>
<li>Smart Street Lighting by Hamburg</li>
<li>Waste monitoring-smart waste collection route (Aarhus, Bradford, Amsterdam?)</li>

<li>There seems to be several similarities between the IOT-in-a-box (Aarhus) and the Data Lake project (Bergen). We wish to continue our contact to see if it makes sense to cooperate.</li>
<li>Bergen wishes to invite the city of Aarhus to participate in one of our sprints as part of the Data Lake project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aarhus University</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>For information: Bergen proposed for Aarhus University that a work group or even a work package on IT architecture be established. This suggestion was supported by Aarhus University.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aberdeen</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>The Data Lake project (Bergen) contains vast amounts of water and sewage data. Bergen will support Aberdeen if requested.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Bradford (water)</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensors installed on roofs in Bergen as well as water and sewage data in the Data Lake project might be of interest to Bradford. Bergen will support Bradford if requested.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bradford University</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Bergen has invited Bradford University to participate in a sprint as part of the Data Lake project (Bergen). Bradford University is hiring a new resource that starts early next year. This resource might visit Bergen to participate in a sprint.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ghent+Digipolis</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Work on TMAAS is relevant for Bergen. We will establish contact and follow up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gothenburg</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel times in Trafiken.nu is based on TomTom data and sensors in the road infrastructure. Bergen will consider going to Gothenburg to run a test on one of our cases (on fire trucks travel times).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Johanneberg Science Park</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Bergen will contact JSP when we develop the living lab concept further as part of the MUST project (Bergen).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hamburg</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Bergen is considering following up Hamburg’s work on their data platform (similar to our own Data Lake project).</li>

<p>Hello everyone <img alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slightly_smiling_face.png" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"/><br/>
Here are Bradford Council’s observations on collaboration from the speed dating session in Ghent.</p>
<p><strong>Århus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smart gritting/salting</li>
<li>Vehicle tracking</li>
<li>Using street lights as sensor mounts</li>
<li>Sensors for monitoring cycle journeys</li>
<li>Århus local authority deal with water pollution.  The water board deals with surface water. Can monitor water quality.  Has contact details for a similar project to Water challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Århus University</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion around collaboration potential</li>
<li>Communication with councillors is important.  Will add value transnationally.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aberdeen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smart waste bins</li>
<li>Winter maintenance – smart grit bins</li>
<li>Using sensors and/or citizens as sensors for bins</li>
<li>Water challenge – potential for knowledge / experience exchange; can compare the different types of sensors to be used and share experience of the tender process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amsterdam</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CCTV and image analytics</li>
<li>Possibility for Bradford to test IoT Register</li>
<li>Water challenge - Provided details of Rainproof.  The project identifies vulnerable areas of Amsterdam, but would need to know how these are identified.  Useful to find out what the performance of the assets is.  Data is collected from smart roofs. – possible Blue-Green infrastructure/climate change challenge?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amsterdam Data Science</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>City liveability - Bradford interested in the concept and willing to assist for research / case study – possible new challenge?</li>
<li>Can look into different ways of communicating.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bergen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive sensor network regards Water challenge and Data Lake experience and historical data.  The local authority is responsible for water and sewerage.  Sensors on rooftops to gauge rainfall - it’s real data, but it’s not modelled.  They have a good, controlled surface water system, so there’s not much flooding. BEGIN project discussed – possibility for Blue-Green challenge?</li>
<li>CCTV?</li>
<li>Clean air zone /emission free zone – possible new challenge?</li>
<li>Mentioned Stavanger possibly working on gullies and route optimisation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bradford University</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Citizens as sensors – Bradford Council can provide introductions to Community groups having an interest in this concept.  Potential for these groups to assist in Water challenge and NFM data collection. Council working on in-house reporting tool.</li>
<li>Video analytics – for blocked gullies / drains</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ghent &amp; Digipolis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CCTV and image analytics</li>

<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>Amsterdam Data Science had interesting discussions with various partners that helped us get a better picture about the challenges different cities are facing. Below is a short summary of the possible collaborations.</p>
<p><strong>Amsterdam</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The City of Amsterdam is interested in systematically improving livability of the neighborhoods</li>
<li>Inske Groenen, who just started her PhD at the University of Amsterdam, will investigate possibilities of using various data streams, such as panoramic images, social multimedia, citizen reports and sensory data for better understanding livability of Amsterdam’s neighborhoods.</li>
<li>On the technology level, we are interested in investigating how such heterogeneous data streams can be effectively combined for improved performance of machine learning algorithms.</li>
<li>We will collaborate with the colleagues from the City of Amsterdam working on related initiatives, such as automatic fine-grained classification of citizen reports and the people who are responsible for the various data sources like panoramas, geo data, and sensor data.</li>
<li>Once the potential of the models is proven in Amsterdam, we will investigate their transferability to the other partner cities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aarhus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are also interested in city livability and they just decided to move a technical department to one of their challenged neighborhoods.</li>
<li>We will keep an eye on the developments at their end</li>
<li>Once our algorithms are ready, we will investigate possibilities of applying them in Aarhus</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aarhus University</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Related to the previous point, Martin Brynskov suggested that there may be relevant livability initiatives at the Aarhus University.</li>
<li>It will certainly help to understand specific local challenges and the promising data sources that Aarhus might offer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aberdeen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The city has an active initiative on community monitoring that may be related to our city livability use case.</li>
<li>We will have to check the data availability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bergen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have several city development project that may be related to our city livability use case. We will look into it once the models are ready.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bradford</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We had a very interesting discussion, and they already connected us to their colleagues working on different livability-related initiatives.</li>
<li>Their research on e.g. resilience of vulnerable communities in Bradford is definitely in line with Amsterdam’s focus on better understanding and improving equality of opportunities in the city’s neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Based on the discussions with the colleagues from Bradford, we decided to put more focus on the data sources that are generally available such as OpenStreetMap, streetview images, and social media.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bradford University</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our research is complementary, which may prove advantageous for the project as we can address the problems from several different perspectives; while Bradford University focuses more on semantics, our main focus is content analysis.</li>
<li>Using the “citizen as a sensor” paradigm could be a particularly interesting topic for collaboration – while in Amsterdam we are working on automatic classification, routing and prioritization of citizen reports about the issues in the public space, Bradford is experimenting with a crowdsourcing-based flooding detection system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ghent + Digipolis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ghent is collecting citizen reports for a certain number of issues, such as garbage.</li>
<li>Once our models are fully operational in Amsterdam, it would be interesting to see if our models for fine-grained classification of citizen reports could be applied in Ghent. We will keep in touch about this topic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Johanneberg Science Park and Göteborg</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Although they are currently focusing on different urban challenges, the “citizen as a sensor” paradigm may prove interesting in their context too; we will keep an eye on the developments.<br/>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>As you know, the role of Aarhus University in the project is crosscutting. Apart from practical communication matters which were covered quite well previously, our conversations during the partner speed dating were therefore focused on understanding what other partners’ expectations from us, the project and external synergies are.</p>
