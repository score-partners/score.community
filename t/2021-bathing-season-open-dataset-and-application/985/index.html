<p>Hi! Friends and fellow travlers in space.</p>
<p>We are in a heep of development for the covid-19 summer “problems”. Right now our city is chasing the best function, app, idea, dataset for worikg out a solution to show “safe” beaches and bathing places in and around Gothenburg. We are working on getting a dataset that is based on the Fiware model and trying to make that into a swedish standard. We are aloso looking into creating a new and improved app that will help you find the beaches and to gether with that a better map for goteborg.se.</p>
<p>What great ideas do you guy/girls have that i need to find/share/see?<br/>
Is this someting you would like to follow in some capasity?<br/>
What services are you going to provide for the summer outdoor activities?</p>
<p>All the best to all you and i hope to see you all real soon.</p>
<p>/ Kim</p>

<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>Could there be an opportunity for some replication in Bradford? <img alt=":thinking:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/thinking.png" title=":thinking:"/></p>
<p>Currently in UK, ‘Bathing Water Quality’ status is only applicable to coastal areas (Bradford is not a seaside area <img alt=":swimming_woman:t2:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/2.png" title=":swimming_woman:t2:"/> <img alt=":icecream:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/icecream.png" title=":icecream:"/> <img alt=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/sunglasses.png" title=":sunglasses:"/> ).<br/>
However a small length of one of our rivers is to become <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/yorkshire-river-wharfe-ilkley-bathing-water-status-uk-first" rel="nofollow noopener">the first inland watercourse to get Bathing Water status.</a><br/>
Coincidentally this part of the River Wharfe is where Backstone Beck - which SCORE is monitoring, joins.<br/>
So we’d be happy to find out a bit more about the developments in Gothenburg <img alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slightly_smiling_face.png" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"/></p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
Syd.</p>
