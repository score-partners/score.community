<p>Air quality is highly relevant to Bradford with the Council currently having to report to central Government on it’s proposals for improvements including the possibility of an extensive ‘clean air zone’.<br/>
We have, as part of SCORE, been approached by <a href="http://www.wellnorth.co.uk/pathfinders/well-bradford/welcome-to-well-bradford" rel="nofollow noopener">local healthcare providers</a> regarding help to enable schools and communities to monitor air quality.</p>

<p>Hej Jacco!</p>
<p>I was about to send you and Hugo an email about this.</p>
<p>According to our plan, you will have about 1 hour (16:00-17:00) to present Amsterdam’s role in SCORE project and in specific IoT-Registry solution online. The event will be open to the public therefore the audience will be general public and not technicians.</p>
<p>We thought that would be better if you could send us a recorded film or PPT which we can display in case the connection is not good. Of course we can connect online via Skype, Zoom or GoToMeeting or any other online tool that fits you best. Do you have any suggestions?</p>
<p>We would also like to keep some time (about 15 min) for questions and interaction with the audience after your presentation.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@klantto</span> do you have any input on this?</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>We suggest that you record your presentation in advance. Don’t do it live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit your presentation to 15 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use any tool you feel familiar with. Use your own cellphone to record yourself, or use a screen recording software that you like. If you run Windows, you can just click Win+Alt+R to start recording your screen. Then you can do basic adjustments afterwards with the built-in "Photos" app, if needed. If you use Mac, then it is even more easy to arrange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to record your presentation as soon as possible, preferably until Monday morning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you encounter any problem, we can probably help you to find a solution. Just let me know.</p>

<p>Hi Syd!</p>
<p>Gothenburg city is working towards air quality challenge and would like to include this into SCORE as well. Gothenburg’s Environment Admministration is  leading a project called LoV-IoT <a href="http://www.loviot.se/about-the-project/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.loviot.se/about-the-project/</a> . Knowledge from which we would like to share with other SCORE partners. Our idea was this could be connected to the “Environmental Multimedia Citizen Reporting System” solution working group led by Ghent. But of course it can be a challenge working group!</p>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@evdoxia.kouraki</span> and <span class="mention">@sydsimpson</span></p>
<p>On the “Environmental Multimedia Citizen Reporting System” topic it depends how well and concrete we can formulate a joint common solution at this moment with most of the partners that indicated a ‘co-developer’ role.</p>
<p>Scenario A: we get to an agreed formulation of a common general solution &gt; we can continue as a solution working group.</p>
<p>Scenario B: we conclude that we need to structurally generate our ideas and use the D3.1 guidelines to make this initiative one of the six business cases as described in our proposal &gt; don’t kickoff Open311 solution working group and merge this as a common challenge into the ‘Environment’ challenge working group to be launched at the Aarhus meeting.</p>
<p>Or if we have enough partners committed to both scenarios, we can also proceed with both scenarios.</p>

<p>Air quality, as a Challenge, has the potential for a range of Solutions whether as a Citizen Reporting tool, a method to raise public awareness (lots of potential for living labs) or perhaps linked to a traffic management tool.<br/>
I can see Bradford having a requirement for all these but also to supplement the high quality  (and expensive) monitoring that is already in place.</p>
<p>I anticipate some good discussions in Aarhus <img alt=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slightly_smiling_face.png" title=":slightly_smiling_face:"/></p>

<p><span class="mention">@sydsimpson</span> some information below on how you can organise your workshop on 20th of June! I can translate the instructions in English if needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instructions on how to build a air quality sensor (in Swedish):<br/>
<a class="attachment" href="https://score.community/uploads/default/original/1X/c1fb57f557a8f6d1950fe2cc1d31f49d67bed860.docx">Bygginstruktioner till den 5 april LoViotScore.docx</a> (7.3 MB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data collected by the sensors are visualized at <a href="https://luftdata.se/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://luftdata.se/</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensors we ordered were from: <a href="https://r-pi.se/luftdata/luftdatas-luftkitt-med-partikelmatning" rel="nofollow noopener">https://r-pi.se/luftdata/luftdatas-luftkitt-med-partikelmatning</a><br/>
and the type of air quality sensor was DHT22 / ELdosa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also asked the participants to sign a “contract” that they will register the sensors within 2 weeks and provide contact details/area/adress they will install the sensor. We also provided the option to return the sensor at the Environmetal City Deprtment in case something is not working or they don’t want to participate any more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We created a Facebook group where they can share their experiences, ask questions etc. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/luftbubblan" rel="nofollow noopener">www.facebook.com/groups/luftbubblan</a></p>
