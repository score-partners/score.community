<p>I had my check-in call with Martin last week. We discussed how we could kick start work package 6 now, particularly the elements on long term business casing of solutions, ensuring their replicability, and connecting with other initiatives working on replication of solutions across cities.</p>
<p>We also had an interesting discussion about SCOREâ€™s two primary audiences, the project managers and developers, and how to accommodate both their needs and working styles.</p>
<p>We agreed SCORE might benefit from a mix of both active development and capacity building, a forum to help steer technical development, and some support to cities who will be procuring others to implement software rather than building it themselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps the webinar series could be a good start here?</p>
