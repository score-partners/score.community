<p>Hi <span class="mention">@SBK_Hamburg</span> <span class="mention">@HD_Hamburg</span></p>
<p>Ghent is interested in following closely the ‘GeoNetBake’ project in Hamburg. The difference between ‘planning’ and ‘reality on the field’ and how IoT can play a role in bridging that gap is a focus / use case that is getting more and more attention here (in mobility and road works, but also other smart city themes).</p>
<p>We could possibly even evolve to co-developing components in a SCORE solution working group, especially if your current experiments seem to work and the (expected) accuracy is &lt; 0,5m.</p>
<p>GeoNetBake information was somewhat scattered in the SCORE community and google drive for the moment, so with this post I am creating a proper dedicated thread for this.</p>
<p>Current information is <a href="https://score.community/t/d3-4-discussion-of-solutions-template-for-partners/293/6">here</a> and <a href="https://score.community/t/d3-4-discussion-of-solutions-template-for-partners/293/16">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you and looking forward.</p>

<p>Hi Tim,<br/>
I would be the right person. We had a very good telephones conference with Aarhus about GeoNetBake on the 21st of February and I think we should do this with Ghent too. I’ll send you a doodle-link, so that we’ll find time in the next 2 weeks.<br/>
Best regards<br/>
Henning</p>

<p>The call Hamburg-Ghent about GeoNetBake is today. I 've prepared some questions for GeoNetBake team. Thought it would be good to share here as it might be reused for other IoT projects, templates, etc.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>How did you initiate the project? Did you at first test other approaches to collect information on the field, or did you immediately start experimenting with different types of sensors?</td>

</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>To what extend are you progressing to open data / to working in open source? What do you think is reusable at this point? What could be made reusable?</td>

<p>Discussed Use-Cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring of the Beacons</li>
<li>Using the Information for billing and/or Penalty</li>
<li>Using TAPAS (<a href="https://www.smartaarhus.eu/projects/tapas-testbed-aarhus-precision-positioning-and-autonomous-systems" rel="nofollow noopener">Link</a>) for testing GeoNetBake</li>
<li>Use synergyeffects of the planed Stay/Put-project from Aarhus</li>

<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Followers and Co-Developers are very excited about the potential of the Project, but want to await the first tests of the intelligent beacons</li>
<li>First Test data will be available this summer</li>
<li>Telephone conference with all interested Partners in June to talk about the Project Status and future steps</li>

<p>Thank you <span class="mention">@HD_Hamburg</span>, keep us informed. We keep following this for now and will demonstrate the progress to contacts in Ghent Mobility department. At a point when they perceive the concept as replicable/testable in Ghent, we will try to propose a test to Ghent Roadworks department.</p>

<p>We had a short update call yesterday and I would like to give you all a short sum up:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the moment there is a lot of testing together with the three different Providers</li>
<li>The testing takes place at four different places that belong to the LSBG</li>
<li>Real field tests on the streets will follow afterwards</li>
<li>At the end of September there will be a short Video about the Project, made for the ITS Worldcongress in Singapur</li>
<li>The online Service and data should be available in February/March 2020</li>
<li>Some test data is already available, but it doesn’t meet all requirements by now</li>
<li>Some fieldtests in Aarhus to use the TAPAS infrastructure could be realistic in 2020</li>
<li>At the Moment there is a delay of about 10 seconds between the movement of a beacon and the changes in the polygon</li>
<li>There is a special focus on building the Polygons out of the real time data that is collected</li>
</ul>
<p>We decided to have the next update along the partnership Meeting in Bergen.</p>
