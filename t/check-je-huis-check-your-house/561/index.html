<p><strong>What does it do?</strong><br/>
Check je huis, or in English ‘Check your house’ is an Open Source tool by the City of Ghent and developed by Digipolis Gent. It gives citizens an interactive way of seeing what needs to be done to make their house more carbon neutral. An interactive form gives citizen a low barrier way to calculate their needs, even when they don’t have the specific area measurements or technical isolation data. After filling in the form, they get an overview of prioritised possible improvements, estimations of costs and insights on certain green subsidies they can apply for. The goal is to make more people aware of what needs to be done to have a more isolated and sustainable home. The calculations are based on a scientifically validated matrix of figures that interact depending on the input of the user.</p>
<p><strong>What does it solve?</strong><br/>
It incentivizes citizens to prioritize isolation efforts for their private properties with some nudging towards starting up and contacting contractors. It takes away doubts about isolation norms, subsidies and priorities.</p>
<p>This working group proposal is one of the proposals from Ghent we have analysed more in depth + actualised using the “working group proposal” template.

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>I proposed this solution to the Aarhus Kommune climate secretariat (<a href="https://gogreenwithaarhus.dk/english/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gogreenwithaarhus.dk/english/</a>), but they have decided not to participate, even though the solution looks interesting.</p>
<p>They are working in a number of climate related fields, including informing citizens about possible improvements to further the overall climate agenda, but report that they have not been particularly successful in persuading citizens to make improvements, primarily because heating and electricity prices are reasonable, and the cost/benefit ratio is not sufficient to make citizens want to pay for improvements.</p>
<p>If they or another city department become interested, I’ll let you know.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>
Mikkel</p>

<p>Solution is easy, raise taxes on energy, use that money to subsidize investments on improvements. Double win!</p>
