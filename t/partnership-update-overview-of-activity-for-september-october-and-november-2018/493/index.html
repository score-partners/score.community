<p>Hi community!</p>
<p>Hope you have all had a pleasant holiday season. With reporting well underway, hereby a quick overview of what to expect in the next 3 months, building up to present our achievements at the Smart City Expo in Barcelona.</p>
<h1>General aim</h1>
<p>To summarise the conversations in the past few individual check-ins, working group calls, and work package lead call:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lot of energy in the consortium, and eagerness to to start building things and producing output.</li>
<li>There is a need for more clarity in terms of project processes and how we communicate about the project.</li>
<li>We have experienced some things that don’t work, and are now ready to start formulating this into learnings and approach problems in new ways.</li>
<li>After a period of divergence (generating new ideas and directions) we should now start converging (concretising and agreeing) towards output.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What to expect?</h1>
<p>Here is an attempt to summarise suggested activities for the next few months, with suggestions for who to participate:</p>

<p>Thank you for this Claus!</p>
<p>I would also like to add an activitiy for WP5 - connected to D5.1.<br/>
I would like to undertake an inventory of existing Living Labs in SCORE cities. This would help us to understand where the upcoming solutions will fit best to be tested. My aim is this list to be ready until our next partner meeting in Ghent so each working group will be informed about available LLs. Then each group can discuss and pick up the most suitable ones for their solution testing.</p>
<p>Based on the answers I received last time in February, only Aarhus, Amsterdam, Ghent and Gothenburg have in place living labs/ testbeds. However, I am not fully aware if all of them can be used in SCORE and what is the situation with the rest of the cities. Check the list below.</p>
<p>Therefore, my goal is to get as much information as possible about LLs mentioned below i.e. focus area, structure, ownership, accessibilty, examples of testing and contact person for each of them . This will be a first step for D5.1 “Develop integration &amp; implementation plan”.</p>
<p>Can someone suggest who are the most appropriate person that I can contact from each SCORE city to get this information ? I have posted on SCORE. Community but I did not receive any answer.</p>

<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>After a telco with Eva and Joran last Thursday I made some minutes and actions that I will share with the SCORE partners.</p>
<p>We have made a simple criteria doc for solution adoption, (main criteria:<br/>
1 Interest and real commitment from SCORE partner,<br/>
2 An open system but it goes very slow to get feedback on this.<br/>
Now we have to speed this up, a negative decision is also a decision….</p>
<p>We had a Telco about the IoT Amsterdam registry, which is developed now and to be delivered as a first MVP end September.<br/>
Jacco is leading this project and we met last Friday to go through this process, see the future developments and possibilities in SCORE with the partners.<br/>
We have 2 Amsterdam IoT presentations explaining the reasons for which Amsterdam develops this registry and a document describing the functionality, these are shared on the community otherwise this is redone, just let me know.<br/>
Together with Jacco and Boris Hugo will describe the Amsterdam IoT, what can be provided to the SCORE partners in terms of software explanations, support, resources (time &amp; money) etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>The partners are requested individually if they have serious request to apply, further develop the IoT registry and are hence willing and able to free resources for that.</li>
<li>The partners will be approached individually by Amsterdam (cc Gent WP3 lead) to offer them this solution and if no positive response is received before the meeting in Gent in October it is assumed that no interest exists for this solution from  this partner.</li>
<li>In this way we will know if this SCORE solution is of interest to specific SCORE partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>If approved this approach will then be followed for the other proposed solutions, which were chosen jointly, nut it appears that decision making is more time-consuming and difficult than expected.<br/>
Or the city teams do not have the right teams installed, able to define a) contents, b)transferable technology and c)decision making power over the solutions.</p>
<p>I hope to receive your input and feedback!</p>
<p>Greets,</p>
<p>Hugo</p>

• Partner meeting Ghent<br/>
• Building up to Smart City Expo</p>
<p><span class="mention">@pjppauwels</span> and I created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ymas8Xs_VTy0VgZd1hgMqtQcdP83Vosw2lA9mc311iY/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">new template</a> for all cities to propose new working groups, especially useful for the kind of solution oriented working groups we are seeing, that are based on existing solutions or new to be build solutions/components in cities.</p>
<p>We believe <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ymas8Xs_VTy0VgZd1hgMqtQcdP83Vosw2lA9mc311iY/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">the template</a> contains the necessary information (not too broad and not too narrow/detailed) for a city to announce an existing / new project in the city that is identified as having “SCORE potential”. SCORE potential being the potential to have (parts of) it co-developed transnationally in an open source &amp; open linked data manner. We wanted it to cover the first couple of core questions that such a working group proposal raises, in order to collect interest from other cities. Ofcourse we also attempted to include lessons learned from SCORE so far.</p>
<p>We preferred to immediately test it, so we applied it to 4 working group proposals from Ghent which posted in <a href="https://score.community/c/working-groups/new-working-groups">https://score.community/c/working-groups/new-working-groups</a></p>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@timvanachte</span></p>
<p>Feedback on the template - perhaps include something on ‘common ambition’ for partners - with possible responses ranging from a) collective analysis of challenge and unpack it into possible approaches for solutions, b) compare approaches to solutions, c) identify and develop common components, d) develop common solution?</p>
<p>Perhaps also include some notion of timeframe - when you would like to achieve a certain aim by.</p>
