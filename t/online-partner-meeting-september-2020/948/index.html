<p>Hi all</p>
<p>In Aarhus we’ve discussed the need for some common guiding principles, best practice guidelines, tech stack “standards” and open source’ing guidelines for the development work to really kick in and to support co-creation and sharing. Each city seem to have their own way of doing it – some with internal developers like Gent, Amsterdam and Aarhus and some relying on external resources. Some use one tech stack and some another – and these often do not work in unison. Some are experienced in working with open source and some are not.</p>
<p>The lack of common/shared ways that can act as a foundation for the development projects seems to make it really hard to do actual development work together.</p>
<p>It’s not that everything should be uniform and leave no “wiggle room” for local considerations so maybe a “business architecture” like this would be the way to go:</p>
<p><strong>Shared principles</strong> on</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Tools</li>
<li>Code quality</li>
<li>Considerations on standards</li>
<li>Deployment strategies (CI/CD)</li>
<li>Open Source</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>With  <strong>local implementations</strong> of these guiding principles into a few tech stacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tech stack 1 led by Aarhus: Symfony + Drupal + React</li>
<li>Tech stack 2 led by Another City: tech + tech + tech</li>
<li>Tech stack n …</li>
</ul>
<p>We just discussed this shortly with Juliette who let us know that things are on the way to address this.</p>
<p>Anyhow - we invite all to an open discussion under the title “Considerations on code assurance” (time slot to be confirmed, see the agenda).</p>
<p>Regards,<br/>
Ture, Kim and other friends from Aarhus</p>

<p>Hey Kim,</p>
<p>In the beginning of SCORE we created <a href="https://github.com/score-partners/quality-code">code-quality</a> as part of WP4.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://standard.publiccode.net/">Standard for Public Code</a>, which hopes to enable a standard like this for the wider public organizations software community has the same document as the start but is developed further and more complete.</p>
<p>Would these help with the efforts?</p>

<p>I always learn alot from and with this group of people. Im still keen on the replication part of the work we do. How we can “sell” our ideas to the municipalities and onwards. Im working on our city to sign the <a href="http://LIVING-IN.EU" rel="nofollow noopener">LIVING-IN.EU</a> declaration because i think that is essential for our work. Id love to see you all soon so if you dare come to sweden give me a ring. There is a couch to sleep on if all else fales. CHeers! / kim</p>

Something to improve on: work more on now producing artefacts and plan for measuring impact<br/>

<p>I’m going to bundle all three into one:</p>
<p>In order to share, we need to make things less ‘hardwired’, and a bit more interchangeable. This includes software components, and standards for data.</p>
<p>On the policy level, the case for sovereignty is starting to gain traction, while on the technical level components are well understood.</p>
<p>A good question might then be - what missing thinking or work can we do to help the problem owners/project managers, whose main responsibility is improving citizen services, to also take an interest/invest energy into the architecture or design ‘behind the curtain’ of the solution they are using.</p>
<p>An idea was: a) start with the problem they want to solve, b) work through how data is core to their ability to solve it now and in the future, c) work through how component and standard based systems will help them to continue solving their problems, with an emphasis on risk and governance.</p>
<p>Once they are convinced it is worth spending time and energy into this, things might go a bit smother? <img alt=":airplane:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/airplane.png" title=":airplane:"/></p>

<p>During the meetings I learned that monitoring city livability is much more complex than commonly assumed. In addition to the challenges related to identifying a common set of livability indicators that would be relevant for all SCORE partners, we concluded that the desirable indicator values are highly dependent on the local context.</p>
<p>We should probably not aim at producing a single number summarizing livability of a neighborhood or a city, but invest more time into communicating/visualizing different livability aspects.</p>
<p>We will definitely continue discussion on estimating different livability aspects directly from the visual content (images) and we are curious to see what machine has to say about this highly philosophical question <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
