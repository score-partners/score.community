<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Smart City Expo is taking place in Barcelona next week and SCORE’s participation is more or less planned, so now it is about time to share with all of you what will happen. SCORE will be part of the OASC booth throughout the expo. <a class="attachment" href="https://score.community/uploads/default/original/1X/da1ab1120885927abf087be8857570773fde4fac.pdf">SCEWC2019_Booth (1).pdf</a> (833.7 KB)</p>
<p>We are doing a takeover of the booth <strong>Tuesday 19 November from 9.30-13.30,</strong> where a lot of SCORE related things will take place. This will be the best time slot for all partners to come by the booth and support SCORE. Also, if you have colleagues going there – please suggest them to come by the OASC booth during this specific timeslot.</p>
<p>Justine will demo, and we will have at least three presentations on the stage (One from Amsterdam or AU, one from Bergen and one from Bradford.) I am still hoping to add two more presentations. (And my apologies for the titles of the presentations - I had to come up with something before print deadline on Wednesday.)</p>
<p><a href="https://oascities.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/STW_programme_final_online-1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">You can see the full programme for the OASC booth here.</a></p>
<p>I am looking forward to seeing those of you who are going there next week</p>
<p>Let me know, if you have any questions.</p>
<p>Best,<br/>
Janne</p>
