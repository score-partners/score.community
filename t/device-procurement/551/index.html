<p>Hi <span class="mention">@wburnish</span>,</p>
<p>I’m just putting together a tender for a range of devices but primarily for flow monitoring installations.<br/>
As this procedure is new to me I wondered if you have any tips on what to include in the documentation, any areas that I should make sure are covered, and, any pointers on what to ask for in terms of device specification ?</p>
<p>BTW I met up with Pinacl at the IoTUK Challenge last week. Interested in what Bradford are doing and they mentioned that they’re looking to do work for Aberdeen?<br/>
We’re probably going to include them on the list of tenderers.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Hi Syd<br/>
Let me have a look this week.  We seem to be going down the LoRawan route with the project. ACC seem to have a massive project one to so with Waste and Smart street Ligthing . SO what was a small floodin gproject is now turning int to a large scale project</p>

<p>Any details will be helpful. LoRaWAN works for us as we already have a couple of gateways in place (but coverage still isn’t as extensive as we need).<br/>
It’d be interesting to hear what ACC is doing with waste management and street lights too as these are on our agenda <img alt=":grinning:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/grinning.png" title=":grinning:"/></p>

<p><span class="mention">@wburnish</span> Following our chat during last week’s teleconference I have a link to the EA guidance on flow monitoring:<br/>
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mcerts-minimum-requirements-for-the-self-monitoring-of-effluent-flow" rel="nofollow noopener">mcerts minimum requirements for the self monitoring of effluent flow</a><br/>
It covers some useful points to consider when procuring devices.</p>
<p>I thought our wide ranging discussion was really useful and showed just how similar Aberdeen and Bradford’s Smart City aspirations are.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@sydsimpson</span>  Great meeting you and your colleague last week. I took some minutes of our teleconference.   Yes there was a lot of similarity in proposals.

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@sydsimpson</span> are you including any specifications/standards for open data in your tender? Including for example data format (eg the columns in your excel sheet) or frequency of measurement? In other words, how are you making sure the data from different (future) sensors will be easy to integrate and is compatible/comparable?</p>
<p>Secondly, if you are renting, are you including any contract clauses on your right to open/publish the data for future reuse?</p>

<p>Hi Claus,</p>
<p>Yes, very good points!!<br/>
Thanks for mentioning them.<br/>
We have specified a frequency of measurement and will be ensuring that the IPR / copyright for the data is with the Council. This will allow us to push the data out as open. At this stage we haven’t included a format for the data but shall give that some thought.</p>

<p>OASC data models? The OASC Council of Cities (chaired by Bart Rosseau from the City of Ghent who is also EUROCITIES KSF Data Group chair) will vote to adopt the suggested data models in January. There’s a call soon to present them. If you have data models based on good practice that you think should be included, now is the time. Did I mention that they are adopted by the cities, not pushed by industry. <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/wink.png" title=":wink:"/></p>
