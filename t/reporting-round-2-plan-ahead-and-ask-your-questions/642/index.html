<p>Hello!</p>
<p>A question about progress reporting at OMS and in specific, about the “Outputs” section.<br/>
In this section it is asked to indicate the achieved number of output indicators up to date. From my perspective, all these outputs will be fullfiled later in the project as soon as solutions are developed. Shall we put N/A then under the column “Description of progress” and “0” as achieved number ?</p>
<p>Thank you for the assistance!</p>

<p>Hi Eva,<br/>
You are completely right, as long as the solution is not fully delivered, you keep the number “0”. Nevertheless, feel free to leave a comment in the “Description of progress”, describing your personal work as a beneficiary linked to the single outputs. This is valuable information for the joint report! And if you were not involved (yet), you simply put “N/A”.</p>

<p>Following Are’s question about “Deliverables Section”:<br/>
Seems is not possible to just mention our contribution to a specific WP that we are not leading.  The system is requiring also to fill in all the columns i.e. "Status, “Target groups” etc information that we are not aware of…</p>

<p>Another question  <span class="mention">@h.niesing</span> and <span class="mention">@timvanachte</span></p>
<p>Before submitting the status of WP5 under the “Deliverables section”, I would like to check what are you planning to report for WP3 &amp; 4.</p>
<p>I am planning to report that the status of WP5 is “Behind schedule” since some results that  WP5 needs to use from WP3 and WP4 are not yet finalized. Is this OK ?</p>
<p>What will be the reported  status of WP3 and 4?<br/>
Will it be “Proceeding according to the plan” or “Behind schedule” ?</p>
<p>Thank you<br/>

<p>Hello Joran and Eva,</p>
<p>I had a deadline today, I will have a look at the reporting this afternoon and tomorrow.</p>
<p>It is good to have close insight in the 3 work-packages reporting as they are close connected.</p>
<p>Weather we are delayed or not depends largely on our approach.</p>
<p>I think we should describe the process the project went through in 2018 well.</p>
<p>This means including the difficulties encountered and maybe the overambitious goals…</p>

I thought my colleagues (AS and FLC) approved the progress and finance reports in OMS last week as planned, but discovered today that one signature missed on one of the reports. Anyways, Bergen has submitted both reports successfully now. Sorry for the delay.</p>
