<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>In the 3.4 deliverable, we aim to capture all the information that comes from the different discussions of solutions with the end users in each partner city. Those discussion can be held online, in workshops, …  The goal is to have at least <strong>150 participants in over 9 different meetings</strong> (over all the different partner cities.).</p>
<p>In order to collect all this useful information, we ask all the partner cities who will organize (or already have organised) such a discussion to fill in a template with a few questions concerning the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>How to fill in the template?</strong><br/>
Each partner creates a new topic in this WP3 folder, with the name of the partner in the title.<br/>
–&gt; <em>D3.4 - Partner name</em></p>
<p>In this topic, each partners fills in the questions (see below).The questions should be put in bold, in order to keep a clear overview of the document. Once the template is filled in, other partners are free to comment on the output; give recommendations and feedback…</p>
<p><strong>The template itself</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Logistics</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Date and place of the discussion?</li>
<li>Type of discussion (online, focus group, …)?</li>
<li>How long was this discussion (estimated)?</li>
<li>Who led the discussion? (Moderator?)</li>
<li>How many participants were present?</li>
<li>What is the background of these participants?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2. Discussion topic</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Which solution(s) was/were discussed?</li>
<li>what was the general feeling about the solution(s) among the participants?</li>
<li>Did the participants</li>
</ul>
<p><em>3. Discussion output</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What are the main take-aways after this discussion? (<em>in bullet points</em>)</li>
<li>If possible, write a short conclusions of this discussion (What can we learn from this end-users, what are possible next steps, …)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>4. Discussion evaluation</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What was good about the discussion, what was less good?</li>
<li>In future discussions, would you deal with certain things differently?</li>
<li>Do you have any tips for the other partner cities when conducting these discussions?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are any questions concerning the methodology or the template, don’t hesitate to ask me!</p>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@JoranVD</span>, thanks for this!</p>
<p>one comment - how about we ask partners to post the filled in ‘template’ here on the community? We can then take a screenshot/copy paste it into the drive to archive them as deliverables.</p>
<p>secondly - I know <span class="mention">@pjppauwels</span> at digipolis is already having some great workshops around the travel time solution - could we perhaps get an example of a filled in post?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@evdoxia.kouraki</span> will you be discussing the score challenges/solutions during your event this week?  if so, peraps you could also test run the template and provide feedback?</p>

<p>Hey claus,</p>
<p>To answer your first comment, it is indeed the goal that the differnet partners fill in the template in the community. In my opinion, only this way can fully stimulate the discussion internally between the different partners in this projects.</p>
<p>For the second, I’ll ask Pieter-Jan today!</p>
<p>Thank you for the feedback!</p>

<p><span class="mention">@HD_Hamburg</span> Sorry for my late answer. These questions are not meant to stop proposals but rather to clarify the context of a proposal towards the other partners. I also think existing solutions should be shared so all partners are aware of them even if the originating city doesn’t have plans to develop them further within SCORE, other cities might build further on such existing projects. Let’s include that in the guidelines for new proposals.</p>

we have just discovered the pending new workgroup proposals  table on Google drive. As agreed, we had already replied to the Gent proposals inside each template. Apparently, Aarhus did the same. Though, our replies are not considered in the table that you have created. As we can not edit our pending reply status, please change it for us. For the Amsterdam proposals we are unsure where to reply as we can not find them inside the proposal file on Google drive.</p>

<p>Unless I got the permission settings wrong, you should check with <span class="mention">@claus</span> or <span class="mention">@Boris</span> to be given access to the full SCORE google drive shared folder, with a google account.

<p>Ideally each proposed solution has a <a href="https://score.community/c/working-groups/new-working-groups">corresponding community topic in ‘Propose new Working Groups’</a> where clarifications can be shared with the whole community. Your question also points out the relevance and advantages of using the <a href="https://score.community/t/partnership-update-overview-of-activity-for-september-october-and-november-2018/493/8">template</a> we made.
