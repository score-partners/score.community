<p>Dear all,</p>
<p><span class="mention">@CamillaSandberg</span> and myself, would like to share with you the final version of the “Replication Guidelines - Open source solutions for Public Service Delivery” <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p>The objective of the guidelines is to help you but also project managers, coordinators and decision makers to facilitate the replication of open source smart city solutions from one city to another. They highlight technical aspects of replication, essential considerations for assuring an enabling context for successful replication, as well as how this links to overall initiatives of digital transformation. The guidelines can also be useful for developers and programmers who want to know more about the context for preparation and implementation to be able to work with their city on replication of open solutions.</p>
<p>The document will be presented during the SCORE partner meeting on the  <strong>23rd of September at 10:10-11:00 followed by group discussions</strong> . We are really looking forward to discuss with you how this document can assist you as much as possible!</p>
<p>You can find the document below:</p>

<p>A  <strong>Replicability Assessment tool</strong>  has aslo been developed in order to help you access a solution before replicating it. We will introduce this tool and give more details during our presentation tomorrow.</p>
