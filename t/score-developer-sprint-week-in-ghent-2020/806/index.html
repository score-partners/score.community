<p><em>“Co-development? Hands-on, head first!”</em></p>
<p>After returning from a <a href="https://score.community/t/score-developer-sprint-in-amsterdam/758/8">fruitful SCORE Development Sprint Week</a> in July, the Ghent and Digipolis SCORE teams decided to host the next Development Sprint in Ghent. We invite you to join us at a <strong>new Development Sprint Week</strong> on <strong>16-20 March 2020</strong> in <strong>Ghent</strong>.</p>
<p>While the Development Sprint concept mainly focuses on the technological side (code writing, data diving, tackling common open source challenges, prototyping…), the programme also provides room for <strong>side tracks</strong> where <strong>all partners + all working groups</strong> are invited to co-work on any SCORE tasks &amp; activities. The idea is to form a -highly energized- SCORE team for a week, physically meet, co-develop, go from ideas to common prototype, produce the next iteration of an existing solution, and tackle other challenges together. The group of participants discusses their progress on a daily basis, and we share continuously through a SCORE social media takeover.</p>
<p>We’re sure all previous Developer Sprint participants will testify that the opportunity of taking a ‘hands-on’ approach together for a week really moves forward the SCORE work plan on challenges, solutions, applications and outreach in all work packages.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, please save the date (<strong>16-20 March 2020</strong>), find our <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V67tIiUkfTZRguoLQJIyX60cZvCX42OyKnQDt9ouvls/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">preliminary information here</a></strong> and don’t hesitate to get in touch with Justine and me if you have any question or suggestion. Together with our colleagues, Justine, Jef and me hope to welcome you again in Ghent in March.</p>
<p>PS We chose this particular week so you can enjoy with us the innovative open data and multi stakeholder development ‘vibe’ in our city during the days preceding our annual hackaton <em>AppsForGhent</em> (20-21 March 2020, tenth edition this year, theme: Mobility).</p>
<p>Feel free to forward the invitation to anyone active in SCORE co-development.</p>

<p>This is a really great proposal and the suggestion that ‘non-technical’ partners might be able to participate is very welcome.  The Bergen meeting will be a good opportunity to work out the best way to do this and help maximise the potential of the sprint. <img alt=":+1:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/+1.png" title=":+1:"/></p>

<p><em>Sent the following today to SCORE contacts in Bradford, but can be interesting for other partners and cities.</em></p>
<p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V67tIiUkfTZRguoLQJIyX60cZvCX42OyKnQDt9ouvls/edit" rel="nofollow noopener">preliminary information</a>, the objective of the week is to bring the work and the people together in the same room(s), and have hands-on, tangible outcome oriented sessions with predefined timeslots, and make progress in our co-development efforts amongst cities. The agenda will be finetuned across the SCORE working groups that the actual participants represent, so it is flexible to fit the needs of the people/partners that join. Each timeslot can be different in the actual approach, some can be purely about hacking/coding, other ones focus on the service design sprint concept, some slots can even be about desk researching together or defining requirements / technologic workflows / architectures together. Participants that extend their stay for the weekend, are also invited to join Ghent’s 10th annual -open data oriented- hackaton (as an international hacker or as a visitor).</p>

<p>Hi <span class="mention">@klantto</span> <span class="mention">@agot.watne</span></p>
<p>We are looking to invite speakers for two citizen science initiatives (air quality and AI traffic counting) based on citizen science approaches here in Ghent/Flanders/Belgium. The idea is that insights can be exchanged with SCORE partners.</p>

<p>To those we have not reached out individually yet: an important heads up about the sprint week.</p>
<p>Coronavirus measures are affecting the Development Sprint: the physical meeting in Ghent will be cancelled.</p>
<p>So bad news we are afraid, unfortunately the coronavirus situation in Belgium reached a turning point since yesterday evening. After considerations we decided the most appropriate measure now is to <strong>cancel the physical event</strong> next week. Well, not really cancel, but downscale, reinvent and basically transform it into a 100% remote event. The daily development sessions will be done remotely, and we will revise together with our speakers which side track sessions make sense to hold remotely (so do keep the timeslots available next week to still join the to be revised programme).</p>
<p>While it makes us pretty sad to have to bring you this message and we are sorry for the inconveniences our decision causes, at the same time we realised this actually generates new opportunities for all in the SCORE partnership in terms of applying remote collaboration to discussing, designing and developing SCORE’s solutions. So that is how we, the Ghent SCORE team, are currently looking at things, in a positive way despite the circumstances and doing our best to turn this situation around.</p>
<p>Give us some time to reorganize a bit and more information will follow.</p>
