<p>Hey <span class="mention">@h.niesing</span>,</p>
<p>Could you have a look at the process we’ve formulated before, we think step 1 and 2 are only applicable for ‘Challenge working groups’ while solutions should go through the whole process. I think the document you’ve made needs to be the answer to all the points in ’3 Definition’, and step 3 is making your document together, of the process:</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Linking to the input we promised <a href="https://score.community/t/partnership-update-memo-on-project-management-and-action-plan-jan-2019/685/3">here</a></p>
<p>Following are the elements we think are to be added to the ‘work plans’. We believe these would improve forming a picture and decision making for partners.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge + solutions working groups</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Role/kind of intended contribution of each partner org: code / replication / just feedback / just passive following</li>
<li>Members of working group: the actual persons, each committing to contribute to the work of the working group
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Organisation</li>
<li>Function in organisation</li>
<li>Role in working group (esp. external, ‘non-SCORE’ people invited to working group)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is Bax leading the working group (we think this is a good way to quickly set up working groups in kickstart mode) or has the lead been handed over by one of the partners?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Just solution working groups</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If existing solution: pre-analysis of solution
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>What does it do?</li>
<li>Where is the live demo?</li>
<li>To what extent is it now modular? Which components are reusable? Which are not, or only available by buying license/buying from supplier/etc.?</li>
<li>Where is the code? Is it publicy open source? Is it based on public open source but not public? If it’s not open source, under which open license will it be shared in SCORE?</li>
<li>Which open data does it use? Which formats? Does it ingest open data? Does it generate open data? If not at the moment, how does the SCORE version of it will ingest/generate open data?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If new solution: same questions about how it is intended to be</li>
<li>Current backlog, general outline (especially roadmap items that are linked to the earlier questions on modularity, open source, open data)</li>
<li>Part(s) of that backlog that the leading city aims to co-develop in SCORE</li>
<li>
<a href="https://amsterdam.github.io/guides/track-open-source-health/" rel="nofollow noopener">Open source health</a> (current health, intended health boost thanks to SCORE)</li>

<p>An example by <span class="mention">@pjppauwels</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Check je huis</li>
<li>An interactive form and visual webtool to get more insights in the state of your house, what you can do to improve it and an overview on what grants are there to help you financially.</li>
<li>You can find a Dutch version on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://klimaat.stad.gent/checkjehuis/?q%3Dcheck-je-huis&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1548424332222000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF-qjx0v40gB8cieWvSwwJEFeYBSQ" rel="nofollow noopener">https://klimaat.stad.gent/checkjehuis/?q=check-je-huis</a>
</li>
<li>It isn’t modular, it’s a plug n play web application based on Symfony 2.8 using a fixed data set, but I does have a few plugins. It for example links to our solar and roof maps that are in fact different applications. The data used is static, but localised so you would need to have your own data to have relevant output.</li>
<li>Code on: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/StadGent/Check-Je-Huis&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1548424332223000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNL3WiwBdBuSYl-t7lWh_tjzjcDQ" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/StadGent/Check-Je-Huis</a> under an GPL3 license.</li>
<li>It uses open data from Eandis, the energy company to generate averages for people that don’t know their exact usage and grant data from both the city as well as 3rd party organisations. The results are not send back to the environment agency, so it does not generate data (yet).</li>
