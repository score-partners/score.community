<p>Dear SCORE partners,</p>
<p>During the Bergen partner meeting and reflecting on Eva Britt Isager’s introduction, it occurred to me that the main SCORE Challenges: Water, Mobility and Environment have a direct relationship to the Climate Emergency.</p>
<p><strong>How can the SCORE project help municipalities alleviate and adapt to climate change impacts?</strong></p>
<p>This thread is for partners to put forward ideas relating both to existing and future solutions.</p>
<p>Discussing this with <span class="mention">@Boris</span>  and <span class="mention">@claus</span> , one idea was to have an ‘extra ordinary’ climate emergency partner meeting to better understand the problems and perhaps come up with solutions.</p>
<p>Of course we can’t have a climate change meeting and have everybody fly there!! <img alt=":scream:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/scream.png" title=":scream:"/><br/>
So possibly this could be at a venue easily accessible by train, perhaps Amsterdam or Brussels.</p>
<p>An alternative is to have an extra day at a scheduled partner meeting that we would be attending anyway.<br/>
Certainly I believe Bradford would be keen to host this.</p>
<p>We have already discussed the possibility of an extension to the project. The climate emergency would be a worthwhile reason to have one   <img alt=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" src="../../../images/slight_smile.png" title=":slight_smile:"/></p>
<p><strong>Please add to this thread with any ideas that can help SCORE relate to the climate emergency.</strong></p>
<p>Regards, <span class="mention">@sydsimpson</span></p>
